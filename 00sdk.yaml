# This yaml file creates the kickstarts for the SDK images
#
# It produces ks files that work against both the final released
# version of the Tools project and against the OBS repository.  This
# provides confidence that a release built against the final release
# will behave consistently with an OBS trial build.
#
# kickstarter and mic now support multiple tokens. Typical values:
# @TOOLS_RELEASE@: rolling
# @TOOLS_ARCH@: i486
# @MER_RELEASE@: latest
# @MER_ARCH@: i486

# Hack to substitute Mer's @BUILD_ID@ for @MER_RELEASE@ until Mer
